<h1>Travel Awards for Students Presenting at the Sixteenth Australasian
Document Computing Symposium (ADCS2011)</h1>

<p>The Conference is offering travel support to students coming to
ADCS2011 in Canberra.  These awards can be put toward travel and
accommodation expenses.  While we expect that there will be four
awards of approximately A$500 each, the organising committee reserves
the right to award more or less awards as they see fit, or to alter
the amount of any awards.</p>

<h3>Students: How to apply</h3>

<p>Send an email to the general chair of the conference (Paul
Thomas, <a href="mailto:paul.thomas@csiro.au">paul.thomas@csiro.au</a>)
indicating that you would like to apply for the award, and the amount
for which you are applying.  The email <em>must</em> be cc'ed to your
supervisor.  In the email, you should briefly outline why you should
get the award.  Bullet points addressing the selection criteria below
would be excellent.  Be sure to include your name, your supervisor's
name, and where you will be travelling from.</p>

<p>You must also arrange for your supervisor to send a separate email
acknowledging that you are indeed enrolled as a student, and that the
statements you made in the application are correct (to the best of
their knowledge).</p>

<p><em>Note that the award will be in the form of a reimbursement of
expenses, not a cash award</em>. The awardees will only receive money
after producing receipts for appropriate expenses, and completing any
supplied forms. The reimbursement will be processed through The
University of Melbourne accounts.</p>
